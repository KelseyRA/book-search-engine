# book-search-engine

## Project Description

In this project my goal was to refactor the given RESTful API code to create a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The goal of this application is to allow for a user to search and save books. The user is able to search books without logging in. In order to save the books they are interested in the must sign up and then login. Users are also able to remove books from their collection but they also must be logged in as well.
